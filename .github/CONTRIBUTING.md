# Contributing to FFMD

We are always happy about contributions towards our project. Before you set out on your own, please consider the following:

* If you are from the Magdeburg/Germany area, visit our [meetings](http://www.netz39.de/events/) "Freifunk Bastelabend" and "Freifunk Abstimmungstreffen" to talk about the roadmap and current development efforts.
* [Contact us](https://md.freifunk.net/kontakt/), for development proposals preferably via E-Mail or Jabber.
* If your contribution is not specific to the Freifunk Magdeburg community, please have a look at the respective project, e.g. [gluon](https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon).

To contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Create a branch based off `master` with a meaningful name.
2. When your contribution is ready, create a pull request. If you would like comments on the way, prepend "WIP: " to your PR title.
3. If your contribution should appear in the Changelog, please include a distinct commit adding the respective Changelog entry.
4. We welcome all contributions! We will review the code and there will be comments. Please be prepared for a dialogue, as we also care for quality and making as few errors as possible, so we may request changes or clarifications. Bear with us so that we can come to a nice result.
5. At some point the PR will be merged. Do not forget the follow-up self celebration to keep yourself motivated. :)

Sometimes a PR cannot be merged immediately, for example when we are close to a release or other dependencies need to be resolved first. In this case your PR will be marked with a milestone denoting either a version number or `later`, which means that we will either include the PR at the specific version or we will have to revisit your PR when the firmware is ready. However, there are frequent reviews of open issues and PRs, so we will not forget about the contribution.


Should you have questions, do not hesitate to contact us in person, via E-Mail or in the Jabber MUC (see above).
